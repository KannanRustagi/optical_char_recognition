## Problem Statement - ML-based OCR
<br>
Optical Character Recognition or OCR is a technology that enables the conversion of printed or handwritten text into machinereadable text. OCR is used to extract text from various sources such as scanned documents, images, or even videos, and convert it into
editable and searchable formats.
The process of OCR involves several steps such as scanning the input document or image, segregating individual characters based on
predefined patterns and recognizing them by comparing characters with some known character database or by using machine
learning.
